# Kaggle
I have shared my Codes from my Kaggle competitions here with a short description and the link for the datasets.
<br>
## 1. Intel Image Classification 
<br>
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/pradeep023/intel-image-clf-densenet/data
<br>
This is image data of Natural Scenes around the world. 
This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories which are 'buildings', 'forest' , 'glacier' ,'mountain' , 'sea', 'street' 

## 2. Lung Cancer
<br>
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/pradeep023/lung-cancer-prediction/data
<br>
The accuracy of cancer prediction systems enables people to determine their cancer risk at a cheap cost and aids
them in making the right decisions based on that knowledge. The information is gathered from the online lung cancer prediction system website.

## 3. Parkinson's Disease (PD) classification
<br>
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/pradeep023/parkinson-s-disease-classification
<br>
The speech recordings of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients have been subjected to a number of speech signal processing algorithms, such as
Time Frequency Features, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs),
Wavelet Transform based Features, Vocal Fold Features, and TWQT features, in order to extract clinically useful information for PD assessment.

## 4. All Shark Tank (US) pitches & deals
<br>
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/pradeep023/sharktank-pitch-predictor/data
<br>
Can you predict if a company/product pitch would succeed in Shark tank?
A text vector-based learning system may be able to determine, given a description of a new pitch, 
how likely it is for the pitch to be successful in the shark tank and even which shark might be more interested in the pitch.
